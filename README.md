# Deep Learning Foundation Program
Here you will see three projects, corresponding to three project-related chapters in our deep learning ai-book. You task is to read through the project, run the code in the jupyter notebook to see outputs, and finish the homework provided in the seperate PDF file. 

The homework should be uploaded to every student's own personal github repository and graded by our instructors.
